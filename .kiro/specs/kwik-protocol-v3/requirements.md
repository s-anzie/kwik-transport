# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document defines the requirements for implementing the Kwik Protocol v3.0, a pure transport layer multipath protocol that provides transparent bandwidth aggregation across multiple independent servers. The protocol operates entirely at the transport layer, appearing as a single reliable connection to applications while distributing data across multiple server endpoints for enhanced performance and reliability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Transparent Transport Layer Integration

**User Story:** As an application developer, I want to use standard socket APIs with automatic multipath capabilities, so that I can benefit from bandwidth aggregation without modifying my application code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an application creates a socket connection THEN the transport layer SHALL transparently provide multipath capabilities without code changes
2. WHEN an application writes data to a socket THEN the system SHALL automatically distribute the data across multiple independent server paths
3. WHEN an application reads from a socket THEN it SHALL receive data in the correct order regardless of which server path delivered each segment
4. IF only one server is available THEN the system SHALL operate as a standard single-path connection without errors
5. WHEN multiple servers are available THEN the transport layer SHALL automatically establish paths to optimal servers based on performance metrics

### Requirement 2: Enhanced KCP Protocol

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automatic server discovery and load balancing, so that the system can scale bandwidth without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client connects THEN the Enhanced KCP SHALL automatically discover available servers using multiple discovery mechanisms
2. WHEN bandwidth demand increases THEN the system SHALL automatically add new paths within 10 seconds
3. WHEN a server becomes unavailable THEN the system SHALL detect the failure within 5 seconds and initiate failover
4. WHEN server capabilities change THEN the KCP SHALL update the server registry within 30 seconds
5. IF no suitable servers are found THEN the system SHALL operate in single-path mode and log the limitation

### Requirement 3: Intelligent Bandwidth Scaling

**User Story:** As an application user, I want the system to automatically provide optimal bandwidth, so that my transfers complete as quickly as possible without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN application bandwidth usage exceeds 80% of current capacity THEN the system SHALL initiate path addition within 5 seconds
2. WHEN bandwidth usage drops below 30% for more than 60 seconds THEN the system SHALL remove excess paths
3. WHEN demand patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL proactively scale before reaching capacity limits
4. IF scaling actions fail THEN the system SHALL retry with alternative servers and log the attempts
5. WHEN paths are added or removed THEN existing transfers SHALL continue without interruption

### Requirement 4: Automatic Server Discovery

**User Story:** As a network operator, I want servers to be automatically discovered and managed, so that I don't need to manually configure client connections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN servers are available on the network THEN the system SHALL discover them using DNS-SD, mDNS, and API-based discovery
2. WHEN a new server joins the network THEN it SHALL be discovered and added to the registry within 30 seconds
3. WHEN server capabilities are queried THEN the system SHALL return accurate capability information within 2 seconds
4. IF a discovery mechanism fails THEN the system SHALL continue using other available mechanisms
5. WHEN servers are discovered THEN their trust credentials SHALL be validated before use

### Requirement 5: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want the system to automatically optimize data transfer performance, so that bandwidth utilization is maximized while maintaining low latency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple paths are available THEN the scheduler SHALL distribute traffic to achieve optimal throughput
2. WHEN path performance degrades THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust traffic distribution within 1 second
3. WHEN congestion is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust flow control and scheduling
4. IF performance targets are not met THEN the system SHALL log performance metrics and attempt optimization
5. WHEN network conditions change THEN the system SHALL adapt scheduling algorithms within 5 seconds

### Requirement 6: Security and Trust Management

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want all communications to be secure and servers to be trusted, so that data integrity and confidentiality are maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN establishing any connection THEN the system SHALL use TLS 1.3 encryption
2. WHEN adding a new server THEN the system SHALL validate its certificate and trust credentials
3. WHEN data is transferred THEN end-to-end integrity SHALL be verified using checksums
4. IF a security violation is detected THEN the system SHALL immediately terminate the affected connection and alert administrators
5. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL support multiple authentication mechanisms

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the system to handle failures gracefully, so that service availability is maintained even when individual components fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a path fails THEN traffic SHALL be automatically migrated to healthy paths within 2 seconds
2. WHEN all paths to a server fail THEN the system SHALL attempt to discover alternative servers
3. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be classified and appropriate recovery actions SHALL be taken automatically
4. IF recovery actions fail THEN the system SHALL degrade gracefully while maintaining core functionality
5. WHEN failures are resolved THEN the system SHALL automatically restore full functionality

### Requirement 8: Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and diagnostics, so that I can understand system performance and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL collect and expose performance metrics in Prometheus format
2. WHEN anomalies are detected THEN the system SHALL generate alerts with relevant context information
3. WHEN troubleshooting is needed THEN detailed logs SHALL be available with structured formatting
4. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information to identify root causes
5. WHEN metrics are requested THEN they SHALL be returned within 100ms

### Requirement 9: Transport Layer Compatibility

**User Story:** As an application developer, I want my existing applications to work unchanged with multipath transport, so that I can adopt bandwidth aggregation without rewriting my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN applications use standard socket APIs THEN all socket operations SHALL work identically
2. WHEN applications perform read/write operations THEN data integrity SHALL be maintained across multiple paths
3. WHEN applications use blocking or non-blocking I/O THEN the transport layer SHALL preserve the expected behavior
4. IF applications set socket options THEN the transport layer SHALL honor them across all paths where applicable
5. WHEN applications close connections THEN all associated paths SHALL be properly terminated

### Requirement 10: Scalability and Resource Management

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the system to scale efficiently with load, so that it can handle thousands of concurrent connections without performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN concurrent connections increase THEN the system SHALL maintain performance up to 10,000 connections
2. WHEN memory usage exceeds thresholds THEN the system SHALL automatically free unused resources
3. WHEN CPU usage is high THEN the system SHALL optimize processing to maintain responsiveness
4. IF resource limits are reached THEN the system SHALL apply fair resource allocation policies
5. WHEN load decreases THEN the system SHALL release unnecessary resources to optimize efficiency
