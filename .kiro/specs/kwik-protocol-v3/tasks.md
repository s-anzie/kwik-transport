# Implementation Plan
## Pure Transport Layer Multipath Protocol

This implementation plan converts the pure transport layer multipath design into a series of prompts for a code-generation LLM. The plan follows a bottom-up approach, building core transport primitives first and progressively adding higher-level functionality until we have a complete socket API that provides transparent multipath capabilities.

**Key Principles:**
- **Pure Transport Layer**: Applications use standard socket APIs without modification
- **Independent Servers**: Each path connects to completely independent servers
- **Transparent Operation**: All multipath logic hidden from applications
- **Test-Driven Development**: Each component thoroughly tested before integration
- **Incremental Progress**: No big jumps in complexity

## Implementation Notes

### Key Design Decisions:
1. **Bottom-up approach**: Start with core primitives and build up to socket API
2. **Test-driven development**: Each component thoroughly tested before integration
3. **Incremental complexity**: No big jumps - each step builds on previous
4. **Pure transport focus**: No application-layer awareness or optimization
5. **Standard compatibility**: Full `net.Conn` and `net.Listener` interface compliance

### Critical Success Factors:
1. **Transparent operation**: Applications must be completely unaware of multipath
2. **Performance**: Must provide significant bandwidth improvement over single path
3. **Reliability**: Must handle failures gracefully without application impact
4. **Security**: All communications must be secure with proper trust management
5. **Scalability**: Must handle thousands of concurrent connections efficiently

### Testing Strategy:
1. **Unit tests**: Each component tested in isolation
2. **Integration tests**: Components tested together
3. **System tests**: End-to-end scenarios with real network conditions
4. **Performance tests**: Benchmarks and stress testing
5. **Chaos tests**: Failure scenarios and recovery validation
