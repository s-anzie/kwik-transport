This is a sample file for testing the multi-path demo.
It contains multiple lines of text to test the chunking and aggregation functionality.
The file should be split into chunks and sent via both primary and secondary paths.
Each chunk will be processed and aggregated back into the original file.
This tests the transport layer's ability to handle multi-path data transmission.

Line 6: Additional content for testing
Line 7: More test data
Line 8: Even more test data
Line 9: Testing chunk boundaries
Line 10: Final line of test data

The end of the sample file.
